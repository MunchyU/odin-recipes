        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chicken</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>4 ounces Panang red curry paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon peanut butter</li>
            <li>13.5 ounces coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Chop the onions and peppers into rough 1-inch pieces. Mince the garlic. Then crush the kaffir lime leaves to help release their oils.</li>
            <li>Place a 14-inch skillet (or wok) over medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil. Once the oil melts, add the onions. Sauté for 1 minute, then add the peppers and garlic. Sauté another 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Move the veggies to the sides of the skillet and add the panang red curry paste and peanut butter to the center of the pan. Sauté the curry for 2-3 minutes to intensify the flavor, moving around the pan. Then add the kaffir lime leaves, coconut milk, and fish sauce. Stir to blend.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chopped chicken and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens. Stir occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the basil leaves. Serve with rice, quinoa, or noodles.</li>
